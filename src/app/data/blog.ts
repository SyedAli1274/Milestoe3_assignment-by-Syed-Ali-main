      description: `Shine.com recently did a survey to assess how deeply use of technology is ingrained in our working lives and its impact on us. The survey, targeting almost 600 mid-level employees with three to 10 years of work experience across industries, shows that technology is being leveraged at the workplace by most employees in several ways, from managing their work pipeline, to staying connected to other co-workers, to staying updated on work related matters.
  
  It is no wonder then that almost 85% of people keep themselves updated on the latest technology news and devices. Most of them do it online (77%) and the rest (56%) via friends and colleagues. The impact of technology on working professionals is such that almost 50% cannot even imagine an office without tech amenities. A miniscule 13% only feel that they do not require technology at work.
  
  In fact, almost half the respondents say they carry their own devices to work and almost one fourth are willing to do so, should the need arise. This is not surprising, considering that people generally own at least one or more of several tech gadgets today. Almost 60% people have their own laptops, while 21% own tablets; about one-fourth of people today own two mobile devices.`,

      description: `Improved decision-making and predictive insights 
  AI excels at analysing vast datasets to uncover hidden patterns and insights that human cognition might overlook. This capability aids businesses in making more informed decisions, anticipating customer needs, and predicting future trends. Take, for instance, the retail industry, where AI can analyse consumer buying patterns to recommend personalised products and services, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
  
  Enhanced workplace safety 
  AI also plays a crucial role in ensuring workplace safety and managing risks, particularly in hazardous industries like manufacturing and construction. AI-powered robots and drones can perform perilous tasks, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries. Moreover, AI can analyse data to identify potential safety hazards and predict equipment failures, allowing for timely intervention and proactive measures to prevent mishaps and safeguard employees. 
  
  Adaptation and New Opportunities 
  The impact of AI will vary across industries, necessitating reskilling and upskilling efforts for workers in certain sectors. While some jobs may be displaced, it's essential to recognise the potential for new job creation and opportunities. 
  
  Fields like AI training, data science, and machine learning engineering are set to flourish, with the World Economic Forum predicting the creation of 97 million new jobs globally by 2025.`,

      description: `The dynamics of the Workplace are changing
  In this modern age, globalisation has taken its effect and by its design we are now all interconnected and interdependent all the time, and from every part of the globe. Mobile data and information exchange is a constant. Even social coexistence and connectivity follows the new rules for flexibility and constant availability. People are more connected through technology today then ever in history. Almost everywhere on the globe, people are connected through their devices in one form or another. This kind of mentality has permeated the workplace, and there is now a constant desire for better technology and understanding of this interconnected world. “Hyperconnectivity” determines our life and work now and will have an even greater impact in the future.
  
  The workplace in 2025
  It is time for companies to realise this and take hold of their futures. If companies choose to not make plans for the future workplace, they will face increasing difficulties in recruiting new talent. They will also have to rethink their social and technological strategies in order to not get left behind, and stay ahead of the game. Therefore, we know that the future workplace will replace the known, unchanging hierarchies and departments with small, collaborative team networks. These are the findings of a study commissioned by Fujitsu from the independent European market research firm Pierre Audoin Consultants (PAC). The study “Workplace 2025” outlines the core issues that will change the workplace over the next eight years. It also outlines the recommended steps companies should consider to stay competitive.
  
  Our new reality
  The expectations of the workers are high: 79 percent complain that their workplace does not offer the necessary flexibility; 56 percent have higher safety requirements than are met; 49 percent are convinced that traditional jobs will disappear anyway and 24 percent want more accessibility, also from a technological point of view. There are companies such as tocario (my company), that are working with the idea of creating a digital workplace, where flexibility and accessibility can be achieved.
  
  Employers have already done a lot or planned to reform the work environment. 70 percent want to adjust their company policies. 60 percent oppose or already practice open innovation and crowdsourcing within the company. 30 percent want to invest in analysis tools and almost half can practically imagine working with digital virtual assistants like Amazon’s Alexa. Half of the employers want to implement use cases and environments that are based on consumer behavior. However, only 29 percent of employers want to allow their employees to use end devices of their own choosing. At the same time, end devices will determine how access to information is regulated, how it is shared and distributed securely, and how valuable content is created. This behaviour is based on the constant fear of losing control over on of the most valuable assets a company has: data.
  
  5 important changes in the future workplace 2025
  Cross-generational workplace management and administration
  One of the major changes that will affect the workplace of the future is demographic change. By 2025, a large number of millennials, those born between 1980 and 2000, and thus the so-called “digital natives” will enter the workforce, expecting a better work-life balance and an agile and compelling work environment. At the same time there are Generation X employees who are active in the company until the 1960s and who will work with technologies that will help age not be a hindrance to physical tasks. This diversity of employees in 2025, with their very different preferences and needs, also requires companies to make radical changes in education and development.
  
  There will be greater movement and flexibility
  The study recommends forcing the agility of the “limitless” workplace. In order to continue to be perceived as an attractive employer, companies should develop a contextual and personalized work environment that is tailored to the individual needs of the employee. At the same time, they should strengthen collegial cooperation through the implementation of new technologies, such as augmented reality or digital workspaces. The “Workplace 2025” report predicts that today’s organizational structures will become much more agile and adapt to ever-changing economic conditions, competitors and customer needs. The still prevailing rigid hierarchies and departments are being replaced by small, collaborative network teams of employees and external freelancers, which are linked by unified communication and collaboration platforms and supported by intelligent assistants.
  
  Recruitment via crowdsourcing
  This increased flexibility not only affects the skills required in companies, but also the search for suitable employees. The study concludes that the fastest growing companies in 2025 will be able to quickly identify and develop skills from a global talent pool. Instead of hiring permanent employees for a particular role, the trend is toward global crowdsourcing of freelance talent. Teams of all sizes must be put together quickly and according to their needs. A reliable and flexible technology platform that enables employees to quickly authenticate with biometric data to gain access to the tools and systems they need is essential.
  
  The blurring of borders between industries
  The development and expansion of such networks also poses new challenges to the technologies required. External partners need access to centralized enterprise applications, and cross-enterprise data sharing makes an appropriate security solution essential. In terms of security, companies strive to strike the right balance between providing the tools and frameworks needed for good internal and external cooperation while effectively addressing the continuing threat of cybercrime. The workplace of the future, therefore, needs simple, easy-to-use and adaptive security tools that will not stand in the way of productivity – like Cloud Workspaces.
  
  Companies must lean on technology partners and IT
  As a result of these evolving needs, technology partners are expected to become increasingly important to companies in the future, helping them to manage these new, larger ecosystems and to advise them on other challenges, such as security issues and financial risks. This model of digital co-creation offers the potential of a much higher enterprise value than the market-dominant, rigid contract models. Of course, not all jobs will naturally change so radically. Nevertheless, many companies will have to react in order to be able to win or retain the young employees. It should be borne in mind that 20 percent of administrative employees who work in a modern and forward-looking manner are advancing 80 percent of productive employees in terms of increasing productivity and quality.`,

      date: 'September 15, 2024',
      author: 'Abdul Majid',
      description: `Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we live and work, but its impact on the workplace is not without controversy and heated debate. One of the most significant concerns is the fear that AI will replace human workers, leading to mass unemployment and potentially to societal unrest. While this fear is not entirely unfounded, the impact of AI on the workplace is complex and multifaceted, and it presents both opportunities and challenges for businesses and employees alike.
  
  The Potential of AI
  According to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute, AI could contribute $13 trillion to global economic output by 2030. This estimate is based on the assumption that AI adoption will lead to a 1.2% increase in global GDP growth per year. However, the same study also highlights the potential for job displacement and suggests that up to 375 million workers worldwide may need to switch occupations or acquire new skills to remain employable as AI adoption accelerates.
  
  Increased Efficiency and Productivity
  Despite these concerns, AI also offers significant opportunities and has the potential to revolutionize almost every aspect of our lives. One of the most significant impacts of AI on the workplace is increased efficiency and productivity. AI-powered tools can automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more strategic and creative work. AI can for example automate data entry and analysis, customer service inquiries, and even hiring processes. This increased efficiency and productivity can lead to cost savings, faster decision-making, and improved customer satisfaction.
  
  Improved Decision-Making and Predictive Analytics
  Another impact of AI on the workplace is improved decision-making and predictive analytics. AI-powered tools can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns and insights that humans may miss. This analysis can help businesses make more informed decisions, anticipate customer needs, and predict future trends. For example, retailers can use AI to analyze consumer buying patterns and recommend personalized products and services.
  
  Improved Safety
  AI can also improve workplace safety and risk management. For example, in industries such as manufacturing and construction, AI-powered robots and drones can perform hazardous tasks, reducing the risk of accidents and injuries. Additionally, AI can analyze data to identify potential safety hazards and predict equipment failures before they occur, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to prevent accidents and ensure employee safety.
  
  Changes and New Opportunities
  It's important to note that with the emergence of AI technology, certain industries may be impacted more than others. Reskilling and upskilling may be necessary for workers in industries such as manufacturing and transportation to remain employable. However, it's important to also highlight the potential for new job creation and opportunities in areas such as AI training, data science, and machine learning engineering. The World Economic Forum predicts that AI will create 97 million new jobs globally by 2025, although some existing jobs may be displaced. Additionally, AI can help businesses expand into new markets and develop new products, leading to job creation and economic growth. Collaborating with AI will become increasingly important in the workplace, as it can assist in making better decisions, but cannot replace human intuition, creativity, and empathy.`,

      description: `As users grow their AI literacy skills opportunities to find efficiencies in their own personal workflows will present themselves.

While the time-saving capabilities of AI assistants like ChatGPT are widely touted, the benefits of this transformative technology extend far beyond productivity gains. By strategically integrating AI, organizations can unlock human potential, drive innovation, and cultivate a more engaged and inclusive workforce.

At its core, AI relieves employees of tremendous cognitive load by handling data processing, analysis, and assisting with communication. This is particularly powerful in data-intensive fields like finance, research, and law, where professionals can now reallocate scarce brain power towards higher-value activities like strategic planning and critical thinking and save cognitive drain from lower value tasks.

Using AI has been likened to "wearing an exoskeleton for the brain". As skilled AI users, engaging AI enhanced cognitive superpowers, employees experience a profound sense of confidence and assurance in their work. An AI assistant acting as a knowledgeable aide helps ensure communications are well-researched, nuanced, and consistently high-quality with much less mental energy expended composing them. For client-facing roles, this also elevates performance and strengthens relationships built on clear, professional messaging.

AI is a game-changer for refining workplace interactions through thoughtful word choice, tone modulation, and clarity enhancement. AI enhanced communication skills minimize misunderstandings and errors, while upholding organizational reputation and professionalism across all channels. At times, our messages can mirror our current emotional state. Feeling a bit weary? Input your important message into your preferred generative AI tool and request it to rephrase your communication to match the tone you wish to convey.

Perhaps one of AI's greatest workplace benefits is its ability to promote work-life balance and employee wellbeing. By intelligently managing workflows and offloading rote tasks like document or meeting summaries, AI tools give employees greater control over their time and energy expenditure. Consequently, this enables employees to maintain a more substantial presence in both their work and personal lives and mitigate the risk of burnout often associated with demanding work schedules. AI promises greatly enhanced productivity levels and therefore has the potential to relieve the stress of heavy workloads resulting in a much greater sense of improved wellbeing.

Beyond just reducing strain, AI can be a powerful force for continuous learning and career development when positioned as an intellectual companion. Engaging with an AI assistant provides exposure to new knowledge domains and different ways of thinking - not unlike having an ever-patient, knowledgeable peer to chat with. Challenge yourself by asking GenAI to take a contrary view of a particular topic to widen your perspectives. This augmentation of human intelligence fosters a rich culture of curiosity and growth.

AI can analyze large datasets to identify trends and patterns related to workplace diversity and inclusion. These insights can help organizations understand the effectiveness of their current DEI policies and pinpoint areas needing improvement. AI can assist in monitoring the organization's progress towards DEI goals and recommend adjustments based on real-world data.

IT Systems will become easier to use over time
The future of human/computer interaction is conversational. The rise of conversational AI assistants will see a new era of user-friendly computing that promises to vastly improve employee quality of life. Rather than grappling with the steep learning curves and complex interfaces of traditional enterprise software, employees will leverage AI to accomplish many tasks simply by describing their needs in natural language. Whether it's generating reports, analyzing data, automating workflows, or even building applications, AI will serve as an intuitive co-pilot, reducing frustration and cognitive overload. This democratization of technological capabilities enhances productivity while diminishing the relentless churn of having to master new tools and systems. Employees freed from this constant need to "learn and re-learn" can better focus their mental energies on core competencies and strategic priorities. Workplace AI is poised to be a great equalizer, empowering all employees - regardless of technical acumen - to harness cutting-edge capabilities through seamless conversation alone.

By its very nature, cutting-edge AI inspires engagement and motivation simply by making work more dynamic and interesting. Employees feel empowered using advanced tools that streamline workflows and offer intelligent analyses. This sense of being on the forefront breeds passion and sparks innovative thinking.

      description:` But how can Artificial Intelligence help us with this?
Feelings analysis and other specialized AI tools can help better understand how employees think and feel, allowing companies to design more effective wellness policies and programs, improving the work environment, reducing repetitive tasks, and increasing workplace safety. With this, we can have a positive impact on the mental health of employees.

It can also help the analysis process within the human resources area, easily obtaining employee turnover rates, satisfaction surveys, and diversity data. This data can be used to identify bias and harassment cases, among others.



- Hiring Process
This is a case where it can be both positive and negative. What does the result depend on? Of professional ethics, from both organizations and candidates. It is crucial to address the potential misuse of AI systems. Safeguarding against unethical actions requires a multi-faceted approach, involving ethical design, user education, and legal frameworks to ensure accountability and data privacy. Collaboration between technology companies, policymakers, and society is essential to minimize the risks associated with AI. If we don't, it can be used to deceive both organizations and people.

 

Human resources personnel can use AI to create a job description for any position, just by giving the tool the right prompt to do so. However, candidates can also use the same tools to create a cover letter and modify their CV to fit into the position’s requirements. Doing so, an acceptance of over 90% can be achieved where ATS systems will not be able to catch them, creating many false positives.

Conclusion
As long as the world does not agree on (which is very difficult since agreements are rarely reached) governing the use and scope of Artificial Intelligence, each organization and individual must be responsible for safeguarding against unethical actions. How? For the hiring process use case, the way it is carried out today (and for hundreds of years) must be changed. We have already discussed it in this newsletter (Design Thinking in a Hiring Process).



But, since organizations like to take quick solutions (even if they are more expensive, it does not matter because they want to get out of the problem “fast and easy” even though it is a temporary solution), they will have to increase the number of personnel dedicated to the hiring process, since they will not be able to trust all the CVs until a personal interview is carried out with the candidates to eliminate “false positives”. A better option is to take advantage of the services of head-hunting companies, since they can do this work professionally and personally, eliminating this issue.



I offer you to review your culture, processes, and technology to create a specific strategy and roadmap for your organization with a customer-focused approach, improving the quality of life of employees (innovating and being more efficient) through the use of data, all this enabled by the technology that best suits your needs.`,
